To build
--------
Ott depends on OCaml version 3.09.1 or later.  In particular, Ott cannot be
compiled with OCaml 3.08.  It also touched an OCaml bug in 3.10.0 for amd64,
fixed in 3.10.1.



The command

  make world

builds the ott binary in the bin/ subdirectory.  

This will compiles Ott using ocamlopt.  To force it to
compile with ocamlc (which may give significantly slower execution
of Ott), do "make world.byt".


To run
------
Ott runs as a command-line tool. Executing bin/ott shows the
usage and options.  To run Ott on the test file
tests/test10.ott, generating LaTeX in test10.tex and
Coq in test10.v, type:

  bin/ott -i tests/test10.ott -o test10.tex -o test10.v

Isabelle and HOL can be generated with options -o test10.thy and
-o test10Script.sml respectively.

The Makefile has various sample targets, "make tests/test10.out",
"make test7", etc.  Typically they generate:

  out.tex         LaTeX source for a definition
  out.ps          the postscript built from that
  out.v           Coq source
  outScript.sml   HOL source
  out.thy         Isabelle source

from files test10.ott, test8.ott, etc., in tests/.


Emacs mode
----------
The file emacs/ottmode.el defines a very simple Emacs mode for syntax
highlighting of Ott source files.  It can be used by, for example,
adding the following to your .emacs, replacing PATH by a path to your
Ott emacs directory.

(setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name "PATH") load-path))
(require 'ottmode)
